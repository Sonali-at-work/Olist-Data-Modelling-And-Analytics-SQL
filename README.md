## 📌 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Bronze -Raw Ingestion /Raw Data Loading
### 2️⃣ Silver -Cleaned and transformed data
              - Create tables structure for each table.
              - Loading data from bronze layer in this layer.
              - Performed quality checks on columns of each tables to know the anomalies transformations needed.
              - Based on these observations of quality checks
              - Written a Stored Procedure that takes raw data from bronze 
              - tranforms data and stores in the table structures created in this layer.
### 3️⃣ Gold   - Data Modeling 
              - Business-ready fact and dimension tables in form of views
              - Galaxy schema
              - Checks referntial integrity ,whether is maintained or not in the data model(Galaxy Schema) created
### 4️⃣ Analytics & Reporting
       - Sql -based analysis, Exploratory Data analysis
       - Answering Business KPIs/Problems
       - Analytical queries optimized for performance

### Data Modeling
Overview

The Gold layer follows a dimensional modeling approach optimized for analytical and reporting use cases.
The model is designed using a Fact Constellation (Galaxy Schema), where multiple fact tables exist at different grains and share conformed dimensions.

This approach supports:

Flexible analysis at order, order-item, payment, and review levels

High query performance

Clear separation of business entities (dimensions) and measurable events (facts)

### Schema Type

Fact Constellation (Galaxy Schema)

The model contains:

3 Dimension tables

4 Fact tables

Shared dimensions reused across multiple facts

This is intentionally not a single star schema, because the business processes operate at different granularities.

## Dimension Tables

Dimensions store descriptive attributes and use surrogate keys for analytical joins.

### 1. gold.dim_customers

Grain: One row per customer

Surrogate Key: customer_key

Business Key: customer_id

Attributes:Customer identifiers, Geographic details (city, state, zip)

Used by:fact_orders

### 2. gold.dim_products

Grain: One row per product

Surrogate Key: product_key

Business Key: product_id

Attributes:Product category, Physical characteristics (weight, dimensions), Metadata for product analysis

Used by:fact_order_items

### 3. gold.dim_sellers

Grain: One row per seller

Surrogate Key: seller_key

Business Key: seller_id

Attributes:Seller location, Geographic enrichment using aggregated geolocation data

Used by:fact_order_items

### Fact Tables

Fact tables store transactional and event-level data.
Each fact table maintains a clearly defined grain and references dimensions via surrogate keys where applicable.

## 1. gold.fact_orders

Grain: One row per order

Purpose: Tracks order lifecycle and delivery performance

Keys:order_id (degenerate dimension), customer_key (FK to dim_customers)

Measures / Indicators:Order status, Timestamps (purchase, approval, delivery), Delivery delay flags and duration metrics

Connected to:Customers, Payments, Reviews, Order items

## 2. gold.fact_order_items

Grain: One row per order item

Purpose: Captures line-level sales and logistics details

Keys:order_id, order_item_id, product_key (FK), seller_key (FK)

Measures:Item price, Freight value, Shipping limit date

This table represents the core sales fact of the model.

## 3. gold.fact_payments

Grain: One row per payment record per order

Purpose: Captures payment behavior and methods

Keys:order_id

Measures / Attributes:Payment type, Installments, Payment value, Payment sequence

Connected to:fact_orders via order_id

## 4. gold.fact_reviews

Grain: One row per review (1 order_id has many reviews in reviews tbl) -- 1:M Relationship

Purpose: Captures customer feedback and satisfaction

Keys:review_id, order_id

Measures / Attributes:Review score, Comments, Review creation and response timestamps

Connected to: fact_orders via order_id

### Relationships & Grain Alignment

Orders act as a central business process linking:

Customers

Order items

Payments

Reviews

Order items connect products and sellers at the most detailed transactional level.

Dimensions are never joined directly to each other — joined only through facts.

Surrogate keys are used only in dimensions and facts, never in the Silver layer.

## Design Principles Applied

Clear grain definition for every fact table

Surrogate keys used for analytical stability

Business keys preserved for traceability

No dimension-to-dimension joins

Referential integrity validated via data quality checks

Optimized for BI tools and SQL-based analytics

## Summary

This dimensional model accurately reflects real-world e-commerce processes and supports advanced analytics such as:

Delivery performance analysis

Product and seller performance

Customer behavior and satisfaction

Payment method and installment analysis

The use of a Fact Constellation schema ensures scalability, clarity, and professional-grade data warehouse design.
